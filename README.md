# Simple Assert Library for VBA Scripts
When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, I programmed in VBA: but when I became a programmer, I put away childish things and practiced Test-Driven Development.

However, I still occasionally have to write a VBA script, and find a little helper library for assertions quite useful.
